- 👋 Hi, my name is @SkippiCannotCode, a cute antlion!
- 👀 I’m interested in digital art and game development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and potentially Python.
- 💞️ I’m collaborating on a Terraria mod with a friend.
- 📫 Find me at Discord @ SkippiCannotFli#1984.

My name is Skippi. I'm an aspiring developer working towards making great things either through art or code! I'm also a young little antlion who loves to roll around in the sand! Pass me a cheesecake slice and I'll eat it happily!
